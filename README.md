# Silent Division by Zero Error in Node.js

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Node.js: silent failure when dividing by zero.  The `myFunction` attempts to handle zero inputs but only implicitly handles the case of b being 0 leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors when the function is integrated into larger applications.

## Problem

The `myFunction`  does not explicitly throw an error or return a special value when `b` is zero, it silently produces `Infinity` which might be missed leading to further issues. 

## Solution

The provided solution explicitly handles the division by zero case by throwing an error, providing more robust error handling and preventing unexpected outcomes.
